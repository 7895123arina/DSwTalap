      "\n",
      "A Kick: By upsetting the equilibrium of a dreamer you can wake them from a dream and return them to reality. If you‚Äôre dreaming a dream within a dream, each level of the dream has to have its own Kick in order for the one on the higher level to work. So Arthur blew up the elevator to wake them up from the snow fortress dream so they could then be woken up by the car hitting the water. \n",
      "\n",
      "Limbo: A place where dreamers may end up if they go too deeply. It‚Äôs a place where time runs quickly and people seem to forget reality. We‚Äôre told a person flung there might burn out their mind, though somehow Saito, Cobb, and Mal all survive it and escape. Because of the drugs used in the dreamers in Inceptions final mission, we learn a dreamer can in this one instance also be flung into limbo if they‚Äôre killed in the dream. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inception: The practice of entering dreams and planting an idea in someone‚Äôs head. Normally Cobb and his team only invade dreams to steal secrets and they aren‚Äôt sure if Inception is really possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Architect: The person who constructs the dream world inside the mind of the Dreamer. In the final dream of Inception, Ariadne (as played by Ellen Page) is the architect. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Dreamer: The person whose dream you're actually in. When creating a dream within a dream, each level must have a different dreamer. In the final sequence, Yusuf dreams the first level, Arthur dreams the second one, and Eams dreams the third level with the snow fort. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Subject: The person whose subconcious is actually brought into the dream, usually for the purpose of extracting information from them or on rare occasions in order to plant an idea in their mind. In the final sequence, Fisher Jr. is the subject. \n",
      "\n",
      "Totem: An object constructed by someone who plans to invade a dream, whose exact weight and composition only they know. This object can be used to help verify whether you‚Äôre in the real world, or the dream world. Cobb uses a top which, when spun inside a dream never stops spinning. Ariadne constructs a chess piece, which she plans to use as her totem. \n",
      "\n",
      "Projection: A person created by the subconcious mind of the subject. Projections are not real. They function like white blood cells and should the subject begin to realize that the dream he's in isn't his, Projections respond violently and attempt to seek out the Dreamer and destroy him. 2022-11-18 11:50:42+00:00\n",

Third, just ask yourself if you can do anything about it, if not why should stress over about it, right? Take some calming medication, sleep, eat something nice.

I had to sneak out from the school at 2:30 a.m to watch football with my friends under a big treeüòÇthe match was epic because for the first time in football, there is a formation of 9-0-1 , and Barca had 27 shots ON target, Messi missed the penalty, John Terry red card. The one match I'm looking forward is not Chelsea but I hope Argentina can play Portugal in the 2022 Qatar World Cup Final 2022-08-08 09:37:20+00:00\n",

      "486843784 : The most beautiful wedding for me was one of my oldest friend‚Äôs. She‚Äôs American and she got married to the Greek guy, so the wedding was in Cyprus. It was a first destination wedding I‚Äôve attended. I met her when I was studying in China in 2005 (ü´£). She and Marianne and her then-boyfriend (now husband) became my closest friends since then. So Marianne, her husband and their 2 kids and I lived in one villa in Cyprus, so caught up with each other. The wedding united us once again after many years. And it was so unusual seeing Alison in a wedding dress, because she was always a tomboy and quite masculine. She made such a beautiful bride and she was radiant. I took a vacation from work, so we all stayed there for a week and enjoyed the greek sunshine, seaside and food. 2022-07-29 10:49:23+00:00\n",

      "**__Nikokh-Tui, wedding, is the most solemn and large Uzbek ceremony. Traditionally Uzbek people celebrate weddings very richly and cheerfully with peculiar splendor and abundance of guests. Immediate and remote relatives, neighbours, friends and co-workers are invited to this wedding ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      " The festivities begin since the early morning with a festal wedding pilaf prepared in the houses of the groom and bride. Today the morning pilaf is more frequently prepared in cafes or choykhanas: it is more comfortable and less troublesome for the hosts.\n",
      "\n",
      " After the morning pilaf the groom with friends and relatives, musicians and dancers come to the house of the bride. The bride in the wedding clothes is waiting in the special room, where only mullahs (priests) can come in. They ask her marital consent and then read the prayer ‚Äì ‚Äúnikkah‚Äù, which effects a marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      " The second part of the wedding ceremony is the farewell with parents and the home. Friends of the groom ship the bride‚Äôs dowry and the bride say goodbye to her parents and leaves the house accompanied with her friends and relatives, who sing farewell songs.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the husband‚Äôs house women welcome the bride, singing traditional wedding songs. In front of the door there is the white track, payandoz, by which the bride enters the house. She stops before the door and makes ‚Äúostona salom‚Äù, the bow to the new house. Women strew her with flowers, sweets, money wishing her beautiful and rich life.\n",
      "\n",
      " Early in the morning after the wedding party the holiday is continued with the ceremony of Kelin salom (speech of welcome of the bride). \n",

      "486843784 : My favorite movie is Gone with the wind. I love the book as well. I know that nowadays it is controversial because it romanticises slavery, but I still like it. In my opinion it is one of the rare occasions when the movie is almost as good as the book. Also, I grew up in the Soviet Union times, so we didn‚Äôt get access to a lot of foreign movies. Growing up my family was very poor, living in the outskirts of a small southern town. Our tv was black and white old tv with a bad antenna. So, when every New Years Eve one of the 3 or 4 channels would stream Gone with the wind it was so special. Our entire family would gather around to watch. It became our tradition. It was so wonderful watching the world so different from ours and actors so beautiful. 2022-07-26 08:58:30+00:00\n",

However,  I go to my history about two years ago, I have seen a film named \"Risolat\" by Arabic filmmakers. It was been about Muhammad S.A.V and his life. I watched this film with my flatmates who were studying at university. I felt like crying for watching a movie. I don't mean crying for film, but it was up to maybe because of my love for our prophet. I didn't watch it after this, because I love reading books, I create and imagine my heroes.

But through the hostels I‚Äôve made a lot of good friends and met so many amazing people. 2. I also advise going off the beaten pass and building your own itinerary. 3. Don‚Äôt act like a tourist in public places, it makes you an easy target for pickpockets and other scum. 4. Speaking of pickpockets, they target people who wear inconvenient shoes to avoid the victims pursuing them. So wear comfortable shoes. 5. If the worst does happen, do not pursue culprits. Look at the garbage nearby, in most cases they will toss your empty bag in there. 6. As a precaution, if you have serious allergies and other illnesses - wear a bracelet or something that shows that information. Have some basic information (blood type, emergency contacts, etc) somewhere easy to find just in case. 7. Have the copy of your passport/ID with the visa (if applicable) always in person. Don‚Äôt carry the original, if it gets stolen you might end up in trouble. 8. Have your itinerary and tickets printed. 9. Get a separate charger for your phone, camera. 10. Rent a portable wifi transmitter if the country has one and you don‚Äôt want to pay extra for using your own internet abroad. 11. Learn basic phrases in the local language. Your efforts will go a long way in communicating with the locals. 12. Respect the local religion, culture, rules and the law. You don‚Äôt have to accept or understand them, but following and respecting is a must. 13. Finally, for the ladies in here, if someone asks if you are travelling alone, always say ‚Äòno‚Äô. Say that your are travelling with the family and/or friends. Also, you can wear a fake wedding ring üíç, in some countries women aren‚Äôt seen as individuals, they are considered a property of men. So, when they don‚Äôt see a wedding ring, they might think you are a ‚Äòfare game‚Äô and men might start hitting on you or harassing you. When they see the ring, such men will respect you as a ‚Äòproperty‚Äô of another man. These are all so far. I hope I didn‚Äôt scare anyone üòÖ Safe travels! 2022-06-15 09:33:04+00:00\n",

I lived in a really nice one bedroom apartment on the Left bank until recently for 300USD. However, the downside is that the prices are rising because there is an unusual influx of immigrants from nearby countries. So, obviously, the higher demand drives up the prices. Most owners don‚Äôt ask for a deposit. But some might ask for a 100-200$ deposit which then will be returned to you if you decide to move out and you don‚Äôt damage anything. We do sign a legally binding contract, unfortunately, not everyone respects it. Either party might change their minds and the renter might move out without prior notice or a landlord might ask them to vacate the premises. All in all, I think the situation may not look that bad from outside looking in. However, considering that Kazakhstan‚Äôs labour market isn‚Äôt best when it comes to wages, the prices are still a bit on the higher end. 2022-06-02 06:47:37+00:00\n",

I climbed the mountains with two of my friends, but they decided to stay longer at the top, so I descended on my own. However, I got lost somehow. Luckily, I encountered two older Chinese men who showed me the way. But I got lost again, and wondered into a monastery which felt like a set of an old kung-fu movie. üòÖ There was one monk playing a flute, several were practicing martial arts, another one was meditating. They all pretended they don‚Äôt see me - a tourist with a backpack and all. Lol. Too bad I had no camera with me.

Promise me you will study smart And get better marks in your exam.\" I was in tears and hugged him. What a surprised, that time.

      "In 2018, I had a chance to celebrate Eid Fitr at my hometown. I finally met my dad's family members after 6 years been apart. And I met my grandma. She was almost cried, missing me, asking, \"where have you been? Why haven't you meet me? It's been 6 years..\" I held her hand, kiss and slowly tears come out, apologized to her. It was a blessed. I met my dad, too. Eid was in June. In early August the same year, I received a call from my dad, told me that \"Grandma is gone. She just passed away\". I felt my knees losing balance and falling sit on the floor. And I start to cry. I call my nearest cousin, \"bro, let's go back to hometown. Grandma just passed away.\" Once arrived, I saw my dad's crying, because he just lost his mom. So, I go to him and hug him, tightly. He still cried, that time. We try to calm each other down. I stay awake with him for a whole night. Next morning, all of us cousins brought my grandma to the cemetery to buried her. I felt surprised, and hard to believe that she's gone. We just met like 1 1/2 months ago. At the end I feel glad that I had a chance to see her again before she passed.\n",

Don‚Äôt think of me as any kind of a fake, I‚Äôm a student like you and Aijan met recently, like each of you. I am watching the excitement in this group, in general on this topic, and I came to the conclusion that it would be fair to set some symbolic price for Aijan‚Äôs work. God knows she didn‚Äôt ask for anything, but I think we‚Äôre all reasonable people here, and we need to understand that Aijan is wasting his energy, his time and his nerves to train us. And she probably has her own personal affairs and obligations to other people close to her, and she spends this (her personal time) completely free on us, total strangers her people. Whatever Aijan‚Äôs lofty goals may be, but her powers and resources are also limited, I believe, as are all of us, and that this project should not stop somewhere halfway, my proposal is to make somethen the symbolic amount monthly during your course as lessons as a teacher‚Äôs reward. And you yourself will be encouraged not to miss the class, because it is customary that all free is not appreciated.I understand that there will be critics and hula lovers, and will look in my words for a trick or gain, but unfortunately in the world there have always been and will be such people. And adequate among us think will support this idea. P s: in some advanced countries it is strictly forbidden to use someone‚Äôs labor for free. It's Great.

Firstly, I have created this group 2 days ago and we already have nearly 900 people, so that should already tell you that I'm capable.  Secondly, it's only been 2 days! And I've been working, doing free language consultations, writing an article on LinkedIn with my tips for learning English while being ill and STILL interacting with this group. Thirdly, I haven't made any mistakes so far, so why do you guys keep saying that I can't manage this group? When I ask your advice or assistance it doesn't mean that I'm stupid. It means that I want to make everyone feel involved and heard. If you want to criticize feel free to message me privately. I'm fully open to constructive criticism, but at least wait until I actually make a mistake, don't base it on something that didn't happen yet.
