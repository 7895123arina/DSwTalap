According to this, neighbouring Kazakhstan took the lead with 922.7 thousand tourists, and another neighbouring country  Kyrgyzstan is in second place with 821.9 thousand. From the list of leading countries, Russia, Turkey, South Korea, Germany, USA, India, France, Azerbaijan, Israel, Great Britain, Italy, and Spain are in the leading positions in the number of tourists.  In my opinion, most of these tourists are representatives of the IT industry. In January-August 2022, 3 million foreign citizens visited Uzbekistan for tourist purposes.

Second, you need to write down everything you feel, because our brains can be overwhelmed with the thoughts that are running over. Third, just ask yourself if you can do anything about it, if not why should stress over about it, right? Take some calming medication, sleep, eat something nice. I read some quote recently, stressed person is always thinking about how he is gonna build his future and the calm one actually does something for it. 2022-08-16 05:38:20+00:00\n",

It inspires me to do more and spend more time here. However, in order to do more live streams, club meetings, free English lessons I need this club to generate some kind of income for me. As you know, right now, I have a freelance job that pays my bills and it takes up a chunk of my time. Some members have told me to make the club with paid membership, but I don’t want to do that. So, as a compromise, I have decided to create ways for members to donate for the development of the channel. It is completely up to you if you want to donate. I’m not going to force anyone.

      "486843784 : The most beautiful wedding for me was one of my oldest friend’s. She’s American and she got married to the Greek guy, so the wedding was in Cyprus. It was a first destination wedding I’ve attended. I met her when I was studying in China in 2005 (🫣). She and Marianne and her then-boyfriend (now husband) became my closest friends since then. So Marianne, her husband and their 2 kids and I lived in one villa in Cyprus, so caught up with each other. The wedding united us once again after many years. And it was so unusual seeing Alison in a wedding dress, because she was always a tomboy and quite masculine. She made such a beautiful bride and she was radiant. I took a vacation from work, so we all stayed there for a week and enjoyed the greek sunshine, seaside and food. 2022-07-29 10:49:23+00:00\n",

      "**__Nikokh-Tui, wedding, is the most solemn and large Uzbek ceremony. Traditionally Uzbek people celebrate weddings very richly and cheerfully with peculiar splendor and abundance of guests. Immediate and remote relatives, neighbours, friends and co-workers are invited to this wedding ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      " The festivities begin since the early morning with a festal wedding pilaf prepared in the houses of the groom and bride. Today the morning pilaf is more frequently prepared in cafes or choykhanas: it is more comfortable and less troublesome for the hosts.\n",
      "\n",
      " After the morning pilaf the groom with friends and relatives, musicians and dancers come to the house of the bride. The bride in the wedding clothes is waiting in the special room, where only mullahs (priests) can come in. They ask her marital consent and then read the prayer – “nikkah”, which effects a marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      " The second part of the wedding ceremony is the farewell with parents and the home. Friends of the groom ship the bride’s dowry and the bride say goodbye to her parents and leaves the house accompanied with her friends and relatives, who sing farewell songs.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the husband’s house women welcome the bride, singing traditional wedding songs. In front of the door there is the white track, payandoz, by which the bride enters the house. She stops before the door and makes “ostona salom”, the bow to the new house. Women strew her with flowers, sweets, money wishing her beautiful and rich life.\n",

      " Early in the morning after the wedding party the holiday is continued with the ceremony of Kelin salom (speech of welcome of the bride). \n",

So I have two favourite movies. The second one is “Schindler’s list”. This film about German businessman who could save a lot of judens during war. This film is positioned like bio of Oscar Schindler, but many critics say that Spielberg allowed a lot of mistakes. But It doesn’t matter. \n",

      "The second one is “Pianist”. This film is about famous jude pianist from Warsaw. He tried to survive during German occupation. He spent the entire time of the occupation in Warsaw. Survived. Hiding. He was helped by Poles and even a German officer at the end. \n",

      "142702364 : My favorite film is Fight Club. First time when I watched this film was my school. I associate myself with characters of this film (Marla+Tyler). Because I have some mental issues and I’m creative crazy person. I don’t know why it’s my favorite film. All time when I rewatching this movie I find new insights. Maybe it’s because I love director of this film (Fincher) or it was love at first sight.\n",

      "486843784 : My favorite movie is Gone with the wind. I love the book as well. I know that nowadays it is controversial because it romanticises slavery, but I still like it. In my opinion it is one of the rare occasions when the movie is almost as good as the book. Also, I grew up in the Soviet Union times, so we didn’t get access to a lot of foreign movies. Growing up my family was very poor, living in the outskirts of a small southern town. Our tv was black and white old tv with a bad antenna. So, when every New Years Eve one of the 3 or 4 channels would stream Gone with the wind it was so special. Our entire family would gather around to watch. It became our tradition. It was so wonderful watching the world so different from ours and actors so beautiful. 2022-07-26 08:58:30+00:00\n",

However,  I go to my history about two years ago, I have seen a film named \"Risolat\" by Arabic filmmakers. It was been about Muhammad S.A.V and his life. I watched this film with my flatmates who were studying at university. I felt like crying for watching a movie. I don't mean crying for film, but it was up to maybe because of my love for our prophet. I didn't watch it after this, because I love reading books, I create and imagine my heroes.

It’s a free service where local Japanese people show you around for free. Mostly these are retired people, housewives or students who want to meet foreigners and practice their English. I had 2 guides in Kanazawa and 1 in Osaka. I was expecting it to be awkward and strange, but they were amazing. My Kanazawa guides took me around the city for a whole 3 days, instead of just one day as we agreed via email. We actually became friends and we still keep in touch. One of them has 2 kids now, she was pregnant with the 1st one when I was there. We made calls over Skype and video-chatted. She was happy to show me her newborn. It was so special and sweet.

      "486843784 : For those who travel alone I would suggest staying at a nice hostel. I always do that. Since I’m a woman travelling alone, it is a safety precaution for me as well. But through the hostels I’ve made a lot of good friends and met so many amazing people. 2. I also advise going off the beaten pass and building your own itinerary. 3. Don’t act like a tourist in public places, it makes you an easy target for pickpockets and other scum. 4. Speaking of pickpockets, they target people who wear inconvenient shoes to avoid the victims pursuing them. So wear comfortable shoes. 5. If the worst does happen, do not pursue culprits. Look at the garbage nearby, in most cases they will toss your empty bag in there. 6. As a precaution, if you have serious allergies and other illnesses - wear a bracelet or something that shows that information. Have some basic information (blood type, emergency contacts, etc) somewhere easy to find just in case. 7. Have the copy of your passport/ID with the visa (if applicable) always in person. Don’t carry the original, if it gets stolen you might end up in trouble. 8. Have your itinerary and tickets printed. 9. Get a separate charger for your phone, camera. 10. Rent a portable wifi transmitter if the country has one and you don’t want to pay extra for using your own internet abroad. 11. Learn basic phrases in the local language. Your efforts will go a long way in communicating with the locals. 12. Respect the local religion, culture, rules and the law. You don’t have to accept or understand them, but following and respecting is a must. 13. Finally, for the ladies in here, if someone asks if you are travelling alone, always say ‘no’. Say that your are travelling with the family and/or friends. Also, you can wear a fake wedding ring 💍, in some countries women aren’t seen as individuals, they are considered a property of men. So, when they don’t see a wedding ring, they might think you are a ‘fare game’ and men might start hitting on you or harassing you. When they see the ring, such men will respect you as a ‘property’ of another man. These are all so far. I hope I didn’t scare anyone 😅 Safe travels! 2022-06-15 09:33:04+00:00\n",

If you're planning to travel solo, make sure you know someone/somebody. maybe they can offer you accommodation. I don't want to take it for granted but it makes your plan easier. You don't have to pay more money. Maybe your friend will volunteer to bring you around the city. 2022-06-15 08:35:59+00:00\n",

I lived in a really nice one bedroom apartment on the Left bank until recently for 300USD. However, the downside is that the prices are rising because there is an unusual influx of immigrants from nearby countries. So, obviously, the higher demand drives up the prices. Most owners don’t ask for a deposit. But some might ask for a 100-200$ deposit which then will be returned to you if you decide to move out and you don’t damage anything. We do sign a legally binding contract, unfortunately, not everyone respects it. Either party might change their minds and the renter might move out without prior notice or a landlord might ask them to vacate the premises. All in all, I think the situation may not look that bad from outside looking in. However, considering that Kazakhstan’s labour market isn’t best when it comes to wages, the prices are still a bit on the higher end. 2022-06-02 06:47:37+00:00\n",

I climbed the mountains with two of my friends, but they decided to stay longer at the top, so I descended on my own. However, I got lost somehow. Luckily, I encountered two older Chinese men who showed me the way. But I got lost again, and wondered into a monastery which felt like a set of an old kung-fu movie. 😅 There was one monk playing a flute, several were practicing martial arts, another one was meditating. They all pretended they don’t see me - a tourist with a backpack and all. Lol. Too bad I had no camera with me. Yet, it is still one of my most amazing adventures. 😊 2022-06-01 08:28:58+00:00\n",

She was almost cried, missing me, asking, \"where have you been? Why haven't you meet me? It's been 6 years..\" I held her hand, kiss and slowly tears come out, apologized to her. It was a blessed. I met my dad, too. Eid was in June. In early August the same year, I received a call from my dad, told me that \"Grandma is gone. She just passed away\". I felt my knees losing balance and falling sit on the floor. And I start to cry. I call my nearest cousin, \"bro, let's go back to hometown. Grandma just passed away.\" Once arrived, I saw my dad's crying, because he just lost his mom. So, I go to him and hug him, tightly. He still cried, that time. We try to calm each other down. I stay awake with him for a whole night. Next morning, all of us cousins brought my grandma to the cemetery to buried her. I felt surprised, and hard to believe that she's gone. We just met like 1 1/2 months ago. At the end I feel glad that I had a chance to see her again before she passed.\n",

I suppose this show is a real perfect thing. The scenario, actors, decorations, soundtrack, dialogues - everything is brilliant in this show.

Right now, I urgently need (senior) Full stack developers (1-PHP, Symfony; 1 - .net; html) for German companies. PLEASE TEXT ME PRIVATELY IF YOU ARE INTERESTED. Thanks!

Don’t think of me as any kind of a fake, I’m a student like you and Aijan met recently, like each of you. I am watching the excitement in this group, in general on this topic, and I came to the conclusion that it would be fair to set some symbolic price for Aijan’s work. God knows she didn’t ask for anything, but I think we’re all reasonable people here, and we need to understand that Aijan is wasting his energy, his time and his nerves to train us. And she probably has her own personal affairs and obligations to other people close to her, and she spends this (her personal time) completely free on us, total strangers her people. Whatever Aijan’s lofty goals may be, but her powers and resources are also limited, I believe, as are all of us, and that this project should not stop somewhere halfway, my proposal is to make somethen the symbolic amount monthly during your course as lessons as a teacher’s reward. And you yourself will be encouraged not to miss the class, because it is customary that all free is not appreciated.I understand that there will be critics and hula lovers, and will look in my words for a trick or gain, but unfortunately in the world there have always been and will be such people. And adequate among us think will support this idea. P s: in some advanced countries it is strictly forbidden to use someone’s labor for free. It's Great.

      "5031667086 : Друзья, всем привет. Очень рад состоять в такой группе единомышленников. Желаю всем прогрессивного обучения и овладения языком в высокой степени. Не сочтите меня каким-либо подставным лицом, я такой же ученик как и вы и с Айжан познакомился недавно, как каждый из вас. Я наблюдаю за тем, какой ажиотаж происходит в этой группе, вообще по этой теме и пришел к выводу, что было бы справедливо установить некую символическую цену за труды Айжан. Видит Бог, она ни о чем не просила, но полагаю, мы все тут адекватные люди и должны понимать, что Айжан тратит свои силы, время и нервы для нашего обучения. И у нее наверняка есть свои личные дела и обязательства перед другими близкими ей людьми, и она совершенно безвозмездно тратит это (свое личное время) на нас, совершенно незнакомых ей людей. Какие бы благородные цели Айжан не преследовала, однако ее силы и ресурсы тоже ограничены я полагаю, как и у каждого из нас и дабы, этот проект не остановился где-нибудь на пол пути, мое предложение вносить какую-то символическую сумму ежемесячно на протяжении вашего курса занятий в качестве вознаграждения преподавателя. И вам самим будет стимул не пропускать занятия, ибо так заведено, что все бесплатное не ценится. Понимаю, что найдутся критики и любители хулы, и будут искать в моих словах подвох или корысть, но к сожалению в мире всегда были есть и будут такого рода люди. А адекватные среди нас думаю поддержат эту идею. P\\s: в некоторых передовых странах категорически запрещено использовать чей-то труд бесплатно, и это великолепно.

And I've been working, doing free language consultations, writing an article on LinkedIn with my tips for learning English while being ill and STILL interacting with this group. Thirdly, I haven't made any mistakes so far, so why do you guys keep saying that I can't manage this group? When I ask your advice or assistance it doesn't mean that I'm stupid. It means that I want to make everyone feel involved and heard. If you want to criticize feel free to message me privately. I'm fully open to constructive criticism, but at least wait until I actually make a mistake, don't base it on something that didn't happen yet.
